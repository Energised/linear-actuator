Description: Server for controlling the open source syringe pump from a Raspberry Pi
 The open source syringe pump described at
 http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_syringe_pump is a low cost open hardware
 syringe pump.  This package provides the software to control it.  It runs on
 the Raspberry Pi, with only a motor controller connected to it.  If instead
 you want to use an Arduino, you get more accurate timing of steps.  Franklin
 can then be used instead of this package.
